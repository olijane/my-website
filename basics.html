                <h2>Setting Up Your Bassoon</h2>
                <p>The bassoon has six parts: the boot joint, wing joint, bass joint, bell, bocal, and reed.
                    To protect the instrument and to transport it, the parts are separated and put into an instrument
                    case.</p>

                <p>
                    To set it up, take the boot joint (the fattest joint) and place the wing joint (the long, thinner
                    one) into the smaller hole in the flat part of teh boot joint.
                    The bass joint is similar to the wing joint, but thicker. This goes in the larger hole of the boot
                    joint. The bell slides on top of the bass joint.
                    The bocal's cork slides into the hole in the wing joint. When inserting it, make sure you are not
                    pressing the whisper key down. This controls the pad that covers the only tone hole in the bocal.
                    Pressing it down while inserting the bocal can remove the pad, which would have to be replaced.
                    The reed has to be soaked in water for 2-5 minutes. After it is soaked, it can be slid onto the end
                    of the bocal.
                    And you're done!

                    The bassoon can be played in a chair or standing. Either way it is held diagonally in front of the
                    player.
                    Because it is so heavy, the player needs additional support in order to hold it.
                    The most common forms of support are a seat strap, neck strap, or harness.
                    When sitting down, a seat strap is layed acroos the length of the chair under your legs and attached
                    to the boot joint
                    While standing , players can use a neck strap or harness to hold the bassoon.
                    Some people find a neck strap puts too much strain on their neck and so opt for a harness that
                    distributes the wieght more evenly across the torso.
                    There are many different kinds of harnesses, and choosing one you want requires a bit of research
                    and some trial and error.
                    Some players choose to use a neck strap or harness while sitting as well, though this is not as
                    common.
                    Because the bassoon is held diagonally, the neck strap or harness tends to be pulled to the side,
                    putting more weight on one side.
                    Many use a balance hanger to fix this issue. A balance hanger is installed between the instrument
                    and the strap/harness and shifts the center of gravity to the center rather then the right.
                    To play, your left hand controls the holes and buttons in the upper half of the instrument while
                    your right hand controls the bottom portion.
                    See pictures below.

                <p>Sometimes people use a crutch (or hand rest) to stabilize the right hand. The crutch mounts to the
                    boot joint and secured using a thumb screw. Crutches also help keep your right hand in the proper
                    position.</p>

                <h3>Cleaning</h3>
                <p>
                    Cleaning your wind instrument is vital to get rid of spit and prevent mold from growing (this is
                    more of a concern with wooden bassoons than plastic ones, but it is still important to clean it!).
                    The bassoon has six parts, but only two need to be cleaned: the boot joint and the wing joint.
                    To clean the joints, you need a cleaning rag. This usually comes in the case but can also be bought
                    online or in a local music store.
                    This is because air travels through the bassoon like this:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Drop the string through the hole of the wing joint (3) and grab it where it comes out the other
                        side. Pull the string to pull the rag through. Do this twice.</li>
                    <li>Drop the string into one of the holes of the boot joint (4), then shake the joint until the
                        string falls down the other hole. Grab the string and pull the rag through.</li>
                    <li>Spit pools at the bottom, so cleaning the bass joint (5) and bell (6) is not necessary.</li>
                    <li>Make sure not to leave the cleaning rags inside the joints!</li>
