                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    The <em>bassoon</em> is a musical instrument in the woodwind family, often playing in the tenor and bass ranges. 
                    It is composed of six pieces, including the bocal and reed. 
                    Music for the bassoon is usually written in bass and tenor clef. 
                    Bassoons are primarily made of hard maple or plastic composite materials. 
                    Bassoons are known for their unique sound and versatility. They are excellent for both expressive solos and punchy rhythmic lines.

                <p>This website will explain some information about the basic features of the bassoon:</p>

                <h3>Keys and Holes</h3>
                <p>
                    The bassoon uses a mix of keys and holes to produce different pitches. It has five main holes on the
                    with a
                    sixth that is covered using a key. There are 17 additional keys on the front and back of the bassoon.

                <h3>Range</h3>
                <p>
                    The range of a bassoon begins at B&flat;<sub>1</sub> and extends to G<sub>5</sub>. This means the
                    bassoon can play roughly three octaves.

                <h3>Half Holes and Quarter Holes</h3>
                <p>For the notes F&sharp;, A&flat;, A, and high G&flat; through high C require either a half hole or quarter
                    hole.</p>
                <p>This means that you have to shift your left hand pointer finger to only cover the first tone hole
                    half-way or a quarter of the way. How much you cover the hole depends on your bassoon.</p>

                <h3>Flicking</h3>
                <p>
                    Middle F&sharp;, G, A&flat;, A, and B&flat; tend to crack at the start of the note on many bassoons. To
                    create a smoother transition, bassoonists can use the flicking keys to get rid of the crack.
