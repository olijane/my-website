                    The <em>bassoon</em> is a musical instrument in the woodwind family, often playing in the tenor and bass ranges. 
                    It is composed of six pieces, including the bocal and reed. 
                    Music for the bassoon is usually written in bass and tenor clef. 
                    Bassoons are primarily made of hard maple or plastic composite materials. 
                    Bassoons are known for their unique sound and versatility. They are excellent for both expressive solos and punchy rhythmic lines.
