        <!--General stuff about notes on the bassoon-->
        <section id="bassoon-notes">
            <h2>Bassoon Notes</h2>
            <p>
                The bassoon uses a mix of keys and holes to produce different pitches.
            </p>
            <p>
                The range of a bassoon begins at B&flat;<sub>1</sub> and extends to G<sub>5</sub>. This means the
                bassoon can play roughly three octaves.
            </p>
            <p>Use a fingering chart to learn new fingerings. Repeatedly using them in your playing will help you
                remember them. Fingerings vary between players, as each player has to meet their own and their bassoon's
                requirements. Experiment with a tuner to find what fingerings are most in-tune, which speak more, how
                out of tune certain fingerings are, and which ones are the best for fast passages (how in-tune the note
                is matters less if it is only heard as part of a sixteenth-note run). Some of the fingerings will be
                learned as you need them. The front F&sharp; fingering, for example, is used when another fingering that
                requires the right hand thumb is used immediately before or after an F&sharp; to avoid bubbles.</p>

            </div>
            <h3 id="half-and-quarter-holes">Half Holes and Quarter Holes</h3>
            <p>The notes F&sharp;, A&flat;, A, and high G&flat; through high C require either a half hole or quarter
                hole.</p>
            <p>This means that you have to shift your left hand pointer finger to only cover the first tone hole
                half-way or a quarter of the way. How much you cover the hole depends on your bassoon.</p>
            <h2>Scales</h2>

                <div id="scales-text">
                    <p>There are three types of minor scales: natural, harmonic, and melodic. Natural minor scales are
                        played as written on the sheet. Harmonic minor scales raise the 7th by a half-step going up and
                        down the scale. Melodic minor scales raise the 6th and 7th by a half-step only going up; they
                        are lowered
                        again to be as written going down.

        <!--FLICKING and VENTING-->
        <section id="flicking-and-venting">
            <h2>Flicking and Venting</h2>
            <p>
                Flicking involves the left hand thumb momentarily pressing or "flicking" the high A through D keys at
                the beginning of the same notes an octave lower to avoid the notes cracking (brief multiphonics) when
                you slur between octaves. For example, if you are playing middle A and you have to slur to the high A an
                octave above, you can briefly flick the A key as you slur up. Venting is similar, where instead of
                flicking the key, the
                flicking key is held for the duration of the note. Venting effects the pitch and intonation of the note,
                but it usually allows the note to "speak"
                more.
            </p>
            <p>
                For A and B&flat;, use the second key up from the whisper key. For the rest, use the key above the
                previous one. If you have the smallest flicking key (the fourth one up from the whisper key) you can use
                this one for D instead.
                If any of these notes aren't cracking on your instrument, then great! Flicking is a need-based kind of
                thing, though knowing how to can be helpful. Practice flicking smoothly. If your notes is automatically
                going up an octave when you release the
                whisper key, try to keep the pitch down using the "Ah" vowel and thinking the lower pitch.
            </p>
        </section>
        <!--PITCH/BREATH CONTROL and EMBOUCHURE-->
        <section id="pitch-control">
            <h2>Pitch Control</h2>
            <p>Players have a lot of flexibility with their pitch and it is important that the player learn how to
                control their pitch. They do this through a variety of ways (alternate fingerings, reeds, increasing or
                decreasing the length of the bassoon etc.) but the most flexible methods are using embouchure and breath
                support.
            </p>
            <p>Your embouchure is the shape of your mouth and tends to be a bit different depending on instrument and
                player. Double reeded instruments are played with both the upper and lower lip pulled over the teeth,
                often with the upper lip a bit further along the reed for an overbite. The lips provide a cushion
                between the teeth and the reed, and miniscule adjustments can be made by adjusting the pressure the lips
                apply to the reed. In general, though, the embouchure for bassoonists shouldn't change. The embouchure
                is a huge part in sound production, and you typically want to keep this steady.
            </p>
            <p>How much reed in your mouth affects tone and can make low/high notes easier to come out. Less reed tends
                to give a more "reedy" sound and more reed tendsw to be smoother. For me, high notes like to come out
                clearer when I have more reed and low notes are more responsive when I have less reed. Play arouond with
                it and experiment to find what happens for you on your instrument.</p>
            <p>Lowering or raising your jaw lowers and raises the pitch. This is how you tune notes. There is a limit to
                how much you can tighten or loosen your jaw (when the reeds stops producing sound) and at that point you
                need a new solution.</p>
            <p>Breath control determines how stabile your sound is, how quickly you run out of breath, and the overall
                tone. Players have to develop control of the diaphragm, throat, neck, and upper chest, which are all
                used to increase, decrease, and direct air flow. Your breath before you play also effects the sound that
                comes out. When you breathe in, make sure to think "Ahh" in your head. Your mouth will form the shape,
                your breath will form the shape, and you will play with that shape and vowel in mind. Which vowel to use
                depends on the instrument and octave, but bassoonists should use "Ahh" for most of their range and "Eee"
                for the upper register. As you are playing, keeping the tone steady requires practice and muscle
                training, especially for pianissimo, long tones, and keeping all of the notes even.</p>
            <p>If you have imprecise amounts of muscle and/or air pressure for the desired pitch, the note will crack,
                have poor intonation, accidentally produce the wrong impartial, or not speak at all. Practice long tones
                to help with breath control.</p>
            <p>Pitch control is vital for producing a good tone on any instrument.</p>

        <!--ARTICULATION & TONGUING-->
        <section id="articulation">
            <h2>Articulation</h2>
            <p>Articulation describes how muscicians start and end a note. For wind instruments, we use our tongue.
                Hence, why wind players sometimes call articulation tonguing or striking for wind instruments.</p>
            <p>For any reed instrument, we touch the tip of our tongue to the tip of the reed(s). Double reed
                instruments are particularly good at short, staccato tonguing. A silent "tee" is made when we strike the
                reed to cause a slight breach in air flow. For softer articulation, we replace the "t" with "d".</p>
            <p>Articulation is also about how the note is released. This, like the start of notes, will depend on the
                mood of the piece. If the piece is meant to be somber, you don't want to use short, punchy articulation.
            </p>
            <p>Starts of notes can vary greatly: double reed players, especially, are very good at staccato, punchy
                notes. However, we can also produce a beautiful legato, or a breath attack.</p>
        </section>
        <!--VIBRATO-->
        <section id="vibrato">
            <h2>Vibrato</h2> <!--FINISH THIS SECTION-->
            <p>Vibrato is a technique muscicians use during longer notes to make them more interesting and expressive.
                You've probably heard vibrato before from popular singers. The technique can vary between intruments and
                preferences.</p>
            <p>For bassoon, the vibrato should be from the throat. You can also vibrato from lower (like your core), but
                throat vibrato is my preferred method.</p>

        <!--ADVANCED/EXTRA TECHNIQUES: Multiphonics, Circular Breathing, Other tonguing techniques-->
        <section id="other-techniques">
            <h2>Other Techniques</h2>
            <h3 id="multiphonics">Multiphonics</h3>
            <p>A multiphonic is a technique where several notes are produced at once (on instruments that only produce
                one note at a time).</p>
            <p>For woodwind instruments, multiphonics can be produced with different fingerings, different embouchures,
                or voicing the throat with conventional fingerings. Multiphonics can depend on the environment, player,
                and instrument, so techniques used to make on are going to be different.</p>
            <p>For the bassoon, multiphonics can be produced with new fingerings, but are generally heavily influenced
                by embouchure position. Look up different techniques and experiment on your own instrument to see what
                works best for you.</p>
            <h3 id="circular-breathing">Circular Breathing</h3>
            <p>A technique that wind players use to produce a continuous tone without interruption. To accomplish this,
                the muscician breathes <i>in</i> through the nose while simultaneously blow air <i>out</i> through the
                mouth using air stored in the cheeks.</p>
            <p><b>Learning: </b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Hold a finger in front of a thin air stream from the mouth and listen to the wind sound.</li>
                <li>Learn to switch between cheek air and lung air without a jolt in air pressure. You can practice by
                    blowing air through a straw onto/into a cup of water (near surface level) and continuously switch
                    between cheek air and lung air, trying to avoid changes to the bubbling/depression on the surface of
                    the water.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><b>Performing: </b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Fully inhale and begin to exhale and blow out.</li>
                <li>When your lungs are nearly empty, blow the last volume of air into your mouth and inflate your
                    cheeks with part of this air.</li>
                <li>While still blowing this last bit of air out by squeezing the cheeks, quickly fill your lungs by
                    inhaling through your nose before you run out of air in your mouth.</li>
                <li>If done correctly, by the time the air in the mouth is nearly exhausted you can begin to exhale from
                    the lungs again.</li>

        <!--HOW TO PRACTICE: helps with learning things efficiently and remembering them better-->
        <section id="practice-strategies">
            <h2>Practice Strategies</h2>
            <p>You should practice everyday. Even if it's only for 5 minutes. This is because playing an instrument
                involves a lot of muscle memory, and taking even a few days off
                can result in losing some of your progress. Here is a basic outline of a 30 min warm-up session: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Warm-up (arpeggios, scales, long-tones, articulation) ~5 mins</li>
                <li>New/in-progress stuff ~15 mins</li>
                <li>Older stuff (for maintenance/muscle memory) ~10 mins</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Other stuff to note: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't practice all of your scales and arpeggios in one session (unless that is your new/in-progress
                    stuff). For warm-ups, 2-3 scales/arpeggios in the key your pieces are in is good. Rotate the scales
                    you do every session.</li>
                <li>I do long tones over a scale, usually F major. I hold each note for 15-30 secs trying to keep the
                    pitch as steady as possible (use a tuner!).</li>
                <li>My articulation practice is sixteenth-notes. Yours may be different if you struggle with different
                    things, though I always do sixteenths to get my tongue moving quickly before I practice a piece.
                </li>
