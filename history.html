            <h2>Origins</h2>
            <p>
                The exact predecessor of the bassoon is hard to pin down. There are several historic instruments that
                predate the bassoon, but none were quite supplanted by it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout the Middle Ages, there is documentation and surviving examples of an instrument called
                shawms. These bore a resemblance to the bassoon, and were made with either single or double reed and a
                common sight in Europe. A shawm called the bombarde was a cylindrical tube with seven tone holes and
                played using a double reed, bearing a particular resemblance to the bassoon.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout the 16th century, instrument makers developed a range of bombarde shawms that reached lower
                and lower in range to meet the demands of Renaissance music. Eventually this reached the point where the
                instrument was unplayable and difficult to manage at almost 3 meters.
            </p>
            <p>
                The solution was to fold the instrument in half, putting the body back in reach of the player and
                cutting the overall length of the instrument. An s-shaped tube was used and topped with a double reed,
                and the other end was flared to spread the sound as it emerged. This instrument was known as a dulcian.
            </p>
            <p>
                The primary use of dulcians in the late 16th and early 17th centuries was to double the bass line of
                choral pieces. The bassoon got a popularity boost in 1644 when church reformists banned the use of the
                wind organ in the English church due to superstition, and music for services was provided by small
                groups of instruments that included bassoons. In the mid 17th century, composers started weaving solo
                passages for the dulcian in opera, though not always as traditional as in sacred music spaces.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first instrument to be called a bassoon was created in the mid 17th century. The body of the bassoon
                came apart into four pieces: the bell, long joint, boot, and wing joint. It used three keys, and the
                range of the bassoon was a full step lower than the dulcian’s. It was, however, missing two important
                tones in the scale, so it still lacked true chromaticism.

            <h2>Experimentation and Improvements</h2>
            <p>
                During the 18th century, instrument makers experimented with the number, function, and placement of keys
                to maximize sound quality, make fingering more natural, and permit easy overblowing. But the bassoon
                still lacked the two tones in the chromatic range, as well as refinement and consistency of sound
                throughout the scale.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the late 19th century, two competing schools of instrument makers – Buffet in France and Heckel in
                Germany – developed their own variations on the bassoon to improve it. These two variations still exist
                today, though the Heckel/German system is the most popular around the world while the Buffet/French
                system remains popular in France, Belgium, and parts of Latin America. Both systems have their strengths
                and weaknesses that depend on the player. The Heckel bassoon can sound flat and woody, but good players
                succeed in producing a vibrant, singing tone while, a poorly played Buffet can sound buzzy and nasal,
                but good players succeed in producing a warm, expressive sound.

                    <h3>The German System</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Heckel bassoon is credited primarily to teacher, composer, and military bandmaster Cael
                        Almenräder. He wrote extensively about improvements to the bassoon and experimented with new designs while
                        working in an instrument factory. He created a 17 key bassoon with a range of four octaves (bassoons at
                        the time had 8 keys) and made repeated innovations such as increasing the instrument’s volume and
                        improving the part where the tube bends back on itself (the U-tube), making the pitch easier to control. In
                        1831, he formed his own instrument company with Johann Adam Heckel. After his death in 1846, Heckel and
                        his company continued to refine his designs and entered the 20 century as the largest player among
                        bassoon makers. This was largely due to the singing tone quality of their instruments (an improvement on
                        one of the drawbacks of Almenräder’s bassoons).

                    <h3>The French System</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Buffet system is not as popular in recent times, but it still enjoys its own fanbase due to
                        the quality of and distinctiveness of its tone. The French system was more focused on improving
                        keywork, in contrast to the German system’s focus on sound production. The Buffet systems also improved the
                        keywork incrementally, while the Heckel system had a complete overhaul of the instrument. This approach
                        means that the Buffet bassoons fell behind the Heckel bassoons in terms of improvements to intonation,
                        power, and operation over the years, though some say that a Buffet bassoon has a more vocal and
                        expressive quality. In the hands of an expert player, especially, the Buffet bassoon has a quality of
                        expression that is unmatched. The modern Buffet system uses 22 keys and has the same range as the Heckel
                        system, though Buffet bassoons have greater facility in the upper registers, reaching E5 and F5 with
                        greater ease and less resistance. Buffet bassoons have a narrower bore and simpler mechanism, often
                        requiring more complex fingerings. Like other French woodwind instruments, the tone has a certain edge
                        with a more vocal quality, and this has been used effectively in compositions for the French bassoon, though
                        it does not blend as easily as Heckel bassoons.

                Other experiments with bassoon construction in the 19th century include bassoons created for military
                bands that had odd-shaped brass and wooden bells, bassoons in F and G called tenoroons, semi
                contrabassoons, and sub contrabassoons.
