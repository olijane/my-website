            <h2>Reeds</h2>
            <p>
                The bassoon is a double reed instrument, meaning that it uses a double reed to generate sound.
                The two reeds are held against each other with three wires, and slightly curved to create a gap.
                Blowing air through this gap cause the reeds to vibrate against each other, which vibrates through the
                length of the instrument and creates sound.
                Double reeds are delicate and expensive, so be careful with them.
            </p>
            <p>You can buy them online (make sure the person you are buying it from is a bassoonist themselves) or make
                your own</p>

        <!--CARING FOR YOUR REEDS-->
        <section>
            <h2>Fundamentals of Caring for Your Reeds:</h2>
            <p>
                Reeds usually start bright and a little flat. As the reed ages, the cane becomes harder. At it's peek,
                it will have a warm, steady sound that is more in-tune.
                As the reed wears out, it becomes sharper, duller, and more resistant.
                Alternating reeds, making adjustments, and keeping the reed clean and cared for can prolong the reed's
                life.
            </p>
            <div class="lists" id="reed-care-list">
                <ul>
                    <li>Soak your reed in water before playing or adjusting. This can take anywhere from 1 minutes to 5
                        minutes or more depending on the reed. Keep a small container for water on hand.</li>
                    <li>Remove excess water from the butt of the reed by blowing through the tip before playing.</li>
                    <li>If, while playing, you hear or feel spit, either take the reed off the bocal and blow it out or
                        suck
                        the spit through the reed back into your mouth.</li>
                    <li>Store reeds securely in a reed case. Do not keep them in the plastic container used for
                        shipping.
                    </li>
                    <li>Be careful with the reed. Be aware of your surroundings, you can crack your reed if your not
                        careful! Also, be gentle with it. Don't squeeze the tip to open it.</li>
                    <li>Have at least 3 working reeds at all times. Switch every few days to prolong their lifespan,
                        break
                        them in evenly, and prevent mold and mildew.</li>

            <!--REED PARTS-->
            <h3>Parts of the Reed</h3>
            <p>
                Reeds have a few different parts to them. Adjusting any of these parts changes the way the reed is
                played and what kind of sound it makes.
            </p>

            <!--DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM-->
            <h3>Diagnosing</h3>
            <p>
                Before you attempt to modify your reed, you first have to figure out what you want to change.
                Are the low or high registers hard to play? Can you not play soft enough?
                Figure out how many problems there are. Is it only the striking of the note? Look at scraping/adjusting
                the areas that effect striking/tonguing.
                Is the reed too hard or too soft? Too dark or too bright? Too resistant?
                Make sure your support, embouchure, and fingerings are correct and not the issue.
                Once you identify what needs to change, you can figure out what part of the reed needs to be adjusted.
            </p>
            <p><b>Soak your reed before adjustments to avoid splitting.</b> Make sure ypu try the adjustments one at a
                time and test the reed after each adjustment.
                Make small adjustments to avoid taking too much cane off.</p>
            <!--TOOLS: what I can think of for now-->
            <h3>Tools</h3>
            <div class="lists" id="tools-list">
                <ul>
                    <li>Mandrel</li>
                    <li>Plaque</li>
                    <li>Small knife</li>
                    <li>Small pliers</li>
                    <li>Sandpaper</li>
                    <li>Cutting block</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>Some of these are not needed, but the first four are necessities. You can also get a reed adjusting kit
                which will come with some tools.</p>
        </section>
        <!--BALANCING-->
        <section>
            <h3>Balancing the Reed</h3>
            <p>
                No matter what adjustments you make, you have to keep the reed symmetrical. This means that if you make
                sand down the spine on one side you have to do the same on the other.
                If one side looks thicker than the other, then sand or scrape down the cane on the other side until they
                match. This can be difficult so be strategic and only scrape small amounts off at a time.
                Over time, you will get a better feel for balancing.
            </p>
        </section>
        <!--WIRE ADJUSTMENTS-->
        <section>
            <h3>Adjusting the Wires</h3>
            <p>
                Probably the most common adjustment you will make, adjusting the wires can do a few different things and
                is reversible.
                To start, make sure you have a small pair of plier and a bassoon mandrel. Place the reed in the mandrel
                (this gives it support and stability as you adjust).
                Make sure you squeeze both sides evenly and that you don't over-do it.
            </p>
            <h4>1st Wire</h4>
            <p>This wire should be just tight enough that you can nudge it with your fingernail but not so loose that
                you can move the wire up and down the reed shaft.</p>
            <p>Wires that are too tight choke the reeds and stifle vibrations. Wires that are too loose will fall off or
                move.
                If the wires are appropiately tight, don't adjust them.
            </p>
            <p>To tighten or loosen the wires, insert the mandrel into the butt of the reed, unflatten the twited end of
                the wire with pliers, pull it away from the reed, and make a quarter turn in either direction until
                you've reached the optimum tightness.</p>
            <div class="first-wire">
                <div class="lists opening">
                    <p><b>Loosening:</b></p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Opening and closing the reed is one of the most common adjustments to make.
                To open the reed, gently squeeze the sides of the first wire with your pliers.
                To close the reed, gently squeeze the top and bottom of the first wire with your pliers.</p>

        <!--SCRAPING & SANDING: general areas and what they tend to effect-->
        <section>
            <h3>Scraping and Sanding</h3>
            <p>
                Scraping bassoon reeds is much more difficult, as adjustments cannot be reversed and scraping too much
                off will result in the reed no longer working.
                Use a sharp file or knife and insert a bassoon plaque to support the reed and you scrape.
                Take small amounts of cane off at a time, and play in between to check if it needs more off.
                Figuring out where to scrape to get your desired results take trial and error. There are, however, some
                generalized areas tha you can scrape to hopefully get your desired effect.
            </p>
            <div class="lists scraping-lists">
                <p><b>Spine:</b> Softer/lighter reed. Too much cane makes the reed too hard and stubborn, too little
                    cane causes the reed to collapse.</p>
                <p><b>Tip:</b> Easier articulation and pianissimo in high register.</p>
                <p><b>Center area of tip:</b> Easier tonguing and high register, brighter sound.</p>
                <p><b>Triangular corners:</b> Freer low register and easier tonguing in high register. The more you
                    grind towards the middle, the more flexibilty, better stiking and legato, and darker sound you get.
                </p>
                <p><b>Channels:</b> Flatter low register.</p>
                <p><b>Eyes:</b> More flexible, brighter and more vibrant sound, favors high register.</p>
                <p><b>Heart:</b> The core of the tone. Too little causes the reed to collapse and too much makes a heavy
                    reed with bad striking and little flexibility. Check other places before adjusting here. Can give
                    more freedom, flexibility, easier response, less resistance, brighter sound, and flatter pitch but
                    weaker
                    sound and stability.</p>
                <p><b>Back (back third of reed):</b> Less resistant low register, flatter pitch.</p>
                <p><b>Upper third of reed:</b> Brighter sound, more flexibility, better striking.</p>
                <p><b>Rails:</b> Dampens sound, darker tone, more flexible. Too much off results in imbalance,
                    unstability, stiffness, and resistance.</p>
                <p><b>Bottom third of the rails:</b> Freer reed, flatter pitch, darker tone.</p>
                <p><b>Upper third of rails:</b> More resistance, darker sound, better high register.</p>
                <p><b>Whole reed:</b> Retains overall internal relationship and just makes the reed overall lighter.</p>
                <p><b>Sanding</b> is used for smoothing over the reed (we want all the sections to flow together),
                    removing any gunk, and making smaller adjustments. Use a plaque to avoid breaking the tip as you
                    sand
                </p>
                <p><b>Clipping the tip</b> gives a harder response, more resistance, more shallow sound, sharper pitch
                    and improved stability.</p>

        <!--QUICK TIPS-->
        <section>
            <h3>Other Tips</h3>
            <div class="lists scraping-lists">
                <p><b>Too flat, weak ,or buzzy:</b> Give the reed time to break in. If it is still flat, check the first
                    wire. Thin and taper the tip (or clip). Check the second wire. If none of these work, gently file
                    down
                    the channels and/or the spine to make it a tiny bit shorter.</p>
                <p><b>Too sharp, stuffy, or dark:</b> Make the tube more oval (wires). File/sand from the collar to the
                    middle of the reed evenly. If none of these work, gently file down the channels and/or the spine if
                    it
                    looks uneven (slowly).</p>
                <p><b>High note response:</b> Tighten wires if loose. Check the first wire. Sand the rails in the first
                    third of the reed. Thin and taper tip.</p>
                <p><b>Heavy low register:</b> Check the first wire. Thin the back. Thin and taper the tip.</p>
                <p>If you clip/scrape/sand too much off, there is usually no remedy. Be careful.</p>
