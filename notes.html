            <h2>Keys and Holes</h2>
            <p>
                The bassoon uses a mix of keys and holes to produce different pitches. It has five main holes on the
                with a
                sixth that is covered using a key. There are 17 additional keys on the front and back of the bassoon.
            </p>
            <p>
                There 11 (12 for professional bassoons) thumb keys alone!

            <h2>Range</h2>
            <p>
                The range of a bassoon begins at B&flat;<sub>1</sub> and extends to G<sub>5</sub>. This means the
                bassoon can play roughly three octaves.
            </p>

            <h2>Half Holes and Quarter Holes</h2>
            <p>For the notes F&sharp;, A&flat;, A, and high G&flat; through high C require either a half hole or quarter
                hole.</p>
            <p>This means that you have to shift your left hand pointer finger to only cover the first tone hole
                half-way or a quarter of the way. How much you cover the hole depends on your bassoon.</p>

            <h2>Flicking</h2>
            <p>
                Middle F&sharp;, G, A&flat;, A, and B&flat; tend to crack at the start of the note on many bassoons. To
                create a smoother transition, bassoonists can use the flicking keys to get rid of the crack.
